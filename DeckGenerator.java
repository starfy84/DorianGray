/**
 * Author(s): Matthew Mach, Dereck Tu, William Xu
 * Version: 2.0
 * Date: April 07, 2019
  *
  * Modifications:
  * - Removed textImageHash
  * - Removed cardBack from assigning to cards
  * - Removed all methods relating to text images (createTextImage and createResultTextImage)
  * - Added default result image
  * 
  * Goals:
  * - createTextImage: Render text and save in image pool
  *     - Implement image pool
  *     - Maybe add alignment?
  * - createResultTextImage: Same as above, but text covers card and is centered
  *
  * Description:
  * The main purpose of this class is to organize image generation code and 
  * reduce the amount of times an image is initialize. This should help 
  * organization and run time. Used entirely for deck image generation.
  *
  * Image format:
  *     Cards: /card/(front or back)/Name_deck.png
  *     Text: /text/cleanedText.png
