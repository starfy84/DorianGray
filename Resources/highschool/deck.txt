You faint from exhaustion and wake up in the ER. How'd you let it all go?
You go to university only to drop out, finding no sense of purpose.
"It's too hard. I can't. I'm weak." It's a shame you can't see you're wrong.
You drop out and don't work to get back, no school or employer will take you.
Through thick and thin you held on. Onwards, to your future.
